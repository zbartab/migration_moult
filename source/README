*** Migra1: ***

- the optimal annaul routine program for the migration study. One
  feather quality, territory occupation, and instantaneous migration.


*** Compiling on Linux: ***

- simply type `make' in the source directory. The executable program
  file (called `migra1') will be placed in `../build/' (if it exists)
  or `../' (otherwise).


*** Compiling on Windows: ***

- Get the MinGW compiler from:

  http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-2.0.0-3.exe?download 

- Install it (this is a self-installing exe so it would be easy).

- Set the PATH environmental variable so that it includes the
  `C:\where_MinGW_installed\bin' 

- Start an MS-DOS window

- cd to where the migra1 source files are

- type `make -f Makefile.win'

- the executable (called `migra1') should be in the source directory


*** Running the program: ***

- prepare the ini file (say `kkk.ini')

- start an MS-DOS window

- cd where `migra1' is (the ini file should also be here).

- type `migra1 kkk' to start the program with ini file `kkk.ini'. This
  will generate a lot of output showing the process of convergence. If
  you do not want to see this and/or want to save it type: `migra1 kkk
  > kkk.txt'. This redirect the output to the file `kkk.txt'.


*** Output of the program: ***

- The program generates several files, the most important is `kkk.dat'
  (for `kkk.ini'). This contains the results of the simulation run. 

- The file `kkk.food' contains the amount of food for each `t', `e',
  and `l' (i.e. all weeks, experience classes and locations). This is
  a simple 1-d array, generated by the following code:
  
  for(t=0; t<=MT; t++)
    for(e=0; e<=ME; e++)
      for(l=0; l<ML; l++)
        fprintf(file,"%f\n",G[t][e][l]);

  where G[t][e][l] is the available food. This is scaled up by MR, so
  getting the food on the usual 0-1 scale, you should divide it by
  MR. 

- The files `kkk.??b' are binary dumps of the reproductive values (??
  = rv), the state distribution (?? = st), the probability of actions
  (?? = ac), the probability of moult (?? = mo), and foraging
  intensity (?? = uv). If you need this let me know. 

- The file `kkk.sum' contains the error messages (if any). 


*** The structure of the `kkk.dat': ***

- This file is a table, it should be easily read in an Excel
  worksheet.

- The first line contains the variable names, while the further lines
  are records of individual birds at each week.

- The variables are: 

      * year: the age of the bird, 0 is the year of birth

      * week: the week within year

      * bird: bird ID number

      * event: if the bird is alive event="A", if it died because of
               predation event="P", if it died because of starvation
               event="S".

      * moult1: moulting. If the bird started moult moult1="S", if
		moulting moult1="M", if ending moult moult1="E",
		otherwise moult1="N".

      * action: the bird behaviour. "D" subsist, "B" try to occupy
		territory, "S" start a brood, "K" keep a brood, "A"
		abandon a brood, "AT" abort a brood, "NoD" fly north
		and then subsist there, "NoB" fly north and then try
		to occupy a terr., "SoD" and "SoB" are the same except
		flying to south.

      * res: the energy reserves at the begining of the week

      * fea1: the feather quality at the begining of the week

      * exper: the experience class at the begining of the week

      * brood: the brood age. 0 means no territory, 1 territory
	       occupied, 2 brood started, MA (see `sample.ini') brood
	       abandoned. 

      * loc: the location at the begining of the week

      * uval: foraging intensity during the week
