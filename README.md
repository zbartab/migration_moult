# migration_moult

The code for our optimal annual routine model of avian migration and moult.

This repository contains the source code, the manuscript and an R package
which were used to produce our paper on optimal annual routine of avian
migration and moult.

Our paper has been published as:

Barta et al. 2008, _Optimal moult strategies in migratory birds._ [Phil. Trans.
R. Soc. B (2008) 363,
211â€“229.](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1490/211.short)

This code is provided here in the hope that it might be useful for someone
developing his/her own optimal annual routine model. Note, however, it is
not longer maintained so it can work or might not.
